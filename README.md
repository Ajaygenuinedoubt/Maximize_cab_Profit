# 🚕 Maximize Cab Driver Profit Using Reinforcement Learning

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17bfa7f2-49a8-4749-b7e5-76ec1f961229)




## 📋 Overview

This project aims to **maximize the profit of a cab driver** by developing an intelligent agent using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
We model the cab driver’s day as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, define states, actions, and rewards, and then use **Q-Learning** to find an optimal policy for maximum revenue.

---

## 📚 Problem Statement

A cab driver receives ride requests throughout the day from different cities.  
Each action (accepting/rejecting a request) impacts the driver's **earning and cost** (like fuel, time, etc.).  
Our objective is to:

- **Maximize cumulative reward** (i.e., total profit)
- **Minimize idle time** (driver waiting without customers)

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Environment Design**: Define states, actions, and rewards
2. **Q-Learning Algorithm**:
   - Initialize Q-table
   - Choose actions using **epsilon-greedy strategy**
   - Update Q-values using Bellman equation
3. **Policy Extraction**: Derive the best action for any given state

</div>

- Achieved **steady increase in profits** after training.
- **Learned optimal routes and times** to maximize earnings.
- **Reduced idle time** significantly.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Implement **Deep Q-Learning** (DQN) for a larger action-state space
- Include **real-world constraints** like surge pricing and customer ratings
- Explore **multi-agent RL** where multiple drivers compete for rides
